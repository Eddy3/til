# Installation of OpenGL in Linux

First search all packages that contain OpenGl in linux:  
`apt-cache search opengl`  

There are many free OpenGL implementations in Linux. I installed FreeGLUT because it is the most up-to date version. FreeGLUT is an open source alternative to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit(GLUT) library:  

`sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglew-dev`  

You may also need a C++ compiler to compile the code.  

Also, you may want to install the mesa-utils package in order to use the glxinfo commmand:  

`apt-get install mesa-utils`  

Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API similar to OpenGL.
